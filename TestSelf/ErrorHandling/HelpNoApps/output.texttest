TextTest will write diagnostics in /users/geoff/work/master/Testing/Automatic/texttest
Could not find any matching applications (files of the form config.<app>) under /users/geoff/texttesttmp/texttestgeoff20Aug16:58:26/TestSelf/ErrorHandling/HelpNoApps/TargetApp/Game9952
You probably need to tell TextTest where to find your test files.
The most common way to do this is to set the environment variable TEXTTEST_HOME.
If this makes no sense, read the user guide...
