Could not find any matching applications (files of the form config.<app>) under /users/geoff/texttesttmp/texttestgeoff25Aug11:34:27/TestSelf/ErrorHandling/HelpNoApps/TargetApp/Game9952

Note: the purpose of this help is primarily to document the configuration you currently have,
though also to provide a full list of options supported by both your framework and your configuration.
A user guide (UserGuide.html) is available to document the framework itself.

TextTest didn't find any valid test applications - you probably need to tell it where to find them.
The most common way to do this is to set the environment variable TEXTTEST_HOME.
If this makes no sense, read the user guide...
