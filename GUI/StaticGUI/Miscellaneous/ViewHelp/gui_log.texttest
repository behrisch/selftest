The main things that need migrating are "collate_file" settings which collate multiple files simultaneously. 

=========================================================
COMPULSORY MIGRATION
=========================================================

(1) "collate_file" as applied to multiple files at once
=======================================================

For a long time it has been possible to write in your config file e.g.

[collate_file]
data*:data*.dump

by which it is intended to collate all files that match the pattern on the right
and produce corresponding files without the dump suffix. This functionality
has been completely rewritten since the TextTest 3.15 release to remove
its assumptions about the form of the files and make it work more generally.

Also, the new version actually takes account of what is on the left-hand-side
whereas the old version pretty much took the name of the source file and ignored
what you put there. This is generally where the migration comes in.

The worst that will happen is that a bunch of collated files will change name. For
example if I instead had written

[collate_file]
dumped_data*:data*.dump

the files would still have been called "data*" anyway. Now TextTest will replace
the matched strings and make use of the name in a more predictable way, which may
produce a different name than you had before. It's usually fairly easy to change the
name in the config file if you prefer that over renaming lots of files.

One additional restriction is that only "*" characters may be used in the left-hand-side
patterns: they are effectively replacement markers for the matched values from the source file names. 
Previously any UNIX-style file pattern would trigger this functionality.

See the website documentation of "collate_file" for full documentation of how this now works.

(1) Due to resurrected support on Windows, the configuration 'unixConfig'
is no longer present or necessary. The few UNIX-specific things left
are inferrred by running the configuration 'default' on a UNIX system.

In other words, if your config file says
config_module:unixConfig

delete this line.

(2) This applies to anyone who was tried to measure CPU time or memory consumption
with texttest. The config file format of most settings has changed.

Because any number of resource-related files can now be extracted, the settings are 
now more like the batch settings, each is a section, with type names. So, for example,
instead of

performance_test_resource:model=Opteron250

you would now write

[performance_test_resource]
cputime:model=Opteron250

Likewise, minimum_cputime_for_test and minimum_memory_for_test are replaced by

[performance_test_minimum]
cputime:10
memory:5

The name 'cputime' for UNIX time-generated CPU time is hardcoded. The rest you can 
set yourself. Use the entry

[performance_logfile_extractor]
memory:Memory Usage Is

to tell TextTest how to create the file from your log file. (This replaces 'string_before_memory'.) The file name 'memory' no longer has any special meaning.

There is also a new entry, that can tell it to use a file other than the one indicated by log_file
for this purpose: as follows.

[performance_logfile]
memory:output

In summary, the changes are follows:

Old names                               New Names
=========                               =========
performance_test_machine (list)         performance_test_machine (section)
performance_test_resource (list)        performance_test_resource (section)
<cputime|memory>_variation_% (int)      performance_variation_% (section)
minimum_<cputime|memory>_for_test (int) performance_test_minimum (section)
string_before_memory (string)           performance_logfile_extractor (section)

Note for migrators (or checkers): check your sections end correctly. If you have global level 
settings after a section, an [end] marker will be needed to make sure that they don't end up 
in the section! Otherwise they will not be included.

(example)

[performance_test_machine]
cputime:apple

config_module:default

(This will not work as config_module will be entered in the section [performance_test_machine]. Use an [end] marker after the section.)

General GUI Enhancements:
Static GUI Enhancements:
    - Can now rename files from the drop-down list in the file view (adminactions.py)
    - "Refresh" replaces "Remove Tests" in the default toolbar, mostly for aesthetic reasons (default_gui-static.xml)
	Toolbar contents can be configured/put back, see "personalising the UI" on the website
Dynamic GUI Enhancements:
Framework Enhancements:
    - Now integrates with Atlassian's Jira bugtracking system as well as Bugzilla (jira.py)
	Works in broadly the same way as the bugzilla integration. See website for details.
    - "collate_file" functionality for multiple files rewritten (sandbox.py)
	Patterns of the form "data*:data*.dump" should behave more intuitively, but may not be completely back-compatible.
	Read the migration notes and the website for details.
Historical HTML Batch Report Enhancements:
    - Can now create separate report tables containing (e.g.) performance or memory information. (testoverview.py)
	Use -coll web.performance: see website for details.
    - Cells now have tooltips indicating which test and date they are, to avoid scrolling large tables (testoverview.py)
Grid Engine (LSF/SGE) enhancements:
    - Grid Engine command line now appears in the "Run Info" tab of the dynamic GUI. (textinfo.py)
Self-test/Internal changes:
    - Now automatically pick up a local PyUseCase repository called "pyusecase" (texttest.py)
Bug Fixes:
    - Accelerators for "Cut Test", "Copy Test" and "Paste Test" are disabled when a text widget is focussed (adminactions.py)
	Means you can use Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+C for text in TextTest windows.
    - Worked around a Mercurial bug renaming files with symbolic links in the name (hg.py)
    - "copy_test_path:$ENV_VAR" will now do nothing if ENV_VAR is empty (sandbox.py)
	Previously set it to $TEXTTEST_SANDBOX/. which could cause problems.
    - If a "collate_script" produces an empty file from non-empty input, don't write an empty file (sandbox.py)
    - Don't stacktrace if a "collate_script" doesn't exist (sandbox.py)

Framework enhancements:
    - Plugin scripts (-s option) will no longer be rejected by the framework if no tests are found (engine.py)
	- sometimes they only act on the application anyway.
    - A couple of config file defaults changed: 
	"view_program" now defaults to "emacs" rather than "xemacs" on UNIX, as it is slightly more universally available
	"slow_motion_replay_speed" defaults to 3 instead of 0 (this was more or less a bug)
LSF/SGE enhancements:
    - Unrunnable tests will always report the machine they run on (engine.py)
	Previously some "hard" failures could cause the machine not to be reported
    - performance_test_resource entry now works when machine names in SGE are 'short' (sge.py)
	Previously it only worked if the full domain name was in SGE.
    - If tests report as running but then get terminated hard (e.g. SIGKILL), report them as "killed" (queuesystem.py)
	Previously reported confusingly as "abandoned" - but there was nothing to abandon
    - Finding information in older accounting files in SGE now works (sge.py)
	There has been code lying around to do this for some time but it's never worked until now...
Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed crash on removing tests after starting static GUI from scratch (texttestgui.py,testmodel.py)
	Showed up if the GUI was started with only a config file available.
    - Removing last test from a test suite now removes it from the GUI display also (texttestgui.py)
    - Test completion time on progress bar is now always correct (texttestgui.py)
	It tended to update itself to the current time when clicking around...
    - Collation of files to names containing "." characters is now forbidden (default.py)
	It violates TextTest's naming conventions and hence causes trouble
    - 'Text Info' and 'Viewing' tabs now always appear in the same order (guiplugins.py)
	Viewing tests that were pending in SGE/LSF could cause them to switch before.
    - No longer show spurious files in the static GUI if full temporary path contains "." characters (testmodel.py)
    - External viewers can be started even if the path to the file contains spaces (guiplugins.py)
    - If the script for interpreting core files on UNIX fails, it no longer causes a TextTest crash (predict.py)
    - Fixed crash when an extra_version is rejected for a batch run via batch_version (engine.py)
    - Test data identified by environment variables can now be used as keys in "test_data_searchpath" (default.py)
    - Disable interactive dialogue in console interface after ^C has been pressed (respond.py)
Test Fixes:
    - A certain amount of work done stablising the self-tests and reducing the probability of occasional failures, 
      particularly the tests for SGE/LSF.

========== GtkTextView ==========
To get started quickly, take a look in the self-tests. There are various "TargetApp" directories
to be found. Each of these contains a test-suite for a simple program (which are in turn part
of the larger test suite for TextTest, as it tests itself testing these programs)

To run these apps by hand, go to the TargetApp directory in question and call it, via

texttest -gx  (static GUI - allows management of tests and starting dynamic GUI)
texttest -g   (dynamic GUI - runs tests and shows results in GUI)
texttest -con (console interface)

To understand the test suite, there is always a file called config.<app> (and maybe a few more for 
versions). This tells texttest about the application in question. If nothing else it will have an 
entry called "executable" (or "binary", which is a back-compatibility alias) to tell you what 
executable is being tested.

There will also be a file called testsuite.<app>. This lists subdirectories to be considered either 
as test cases or test suites themselves. Applies recursively you can find the directories which 
represent tests.

A test can define command-line options via the options.<app> file, and also standard input contents 
via the input.<app> file. For GUIs it can define use-case style actions to be performed on the GUI via
the usecase.<app> file. Anything else under the test is "standard results", for example output.<app> 
for the standard output and errors.<app> for the standard error. When the test is run these will be 
compared with the actual results from running the program with the input as defined.

What there is to find:

TargetApp                                  : used by default as it's very basic, this test suite has
                                               one test (that fails) on a "Hello World" program.

TestSelf/TestSelection/TargetApp           : Contains a few tests with related names, to explore the
                                               functionality for selecting tests and saving those selections.
