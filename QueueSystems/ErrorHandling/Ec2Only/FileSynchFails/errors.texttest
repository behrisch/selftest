Make sure you have passwordless access set up correctly. The failing command was:
ssh -q -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=10 ec2-user@10.80.17.112 mkdir -p '/carm/proj/texttest/geoff/Testing' '/tmp/geoff/texttest.ec2cloud.10Dec165215.52273/texttest.ec2cloud/QueueSystems/ErrorHandling/Ec2Only/FileSynchFails'

The command produced the following output:
mkdir: cannot create directory `/carm': Permission denied
